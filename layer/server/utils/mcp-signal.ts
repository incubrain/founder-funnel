/**

 * agent-only transport, so the transport itself is the classification. MCP
 * clients also send wildly inconsistent User-Agents (or none), which
 * `classifyVisitor()` would read as `bot`. The raw UA is kept in `data` so the
 * consumer can still tell clients apart.
 *
 * Call site: `server/utils/mcp-request.ts`'s Nitro middleware, exactly once per
 * `tools/call` request it parses off the raw POST body — *before*
 * `defineMcpTool`'s `cache` option (which wraps the tool `handler` outside this
 * function) can serve a cached response. A repeat call inside a tool's cache
 * window is therefore counted exactly like a cache miss. Individual tool
 * handlers under `server/mcp/tools/` do not call this themselves, so a cache
 * miss isn't double-counted either — this is the single call site.
