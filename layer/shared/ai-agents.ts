/**
 * AI user-agent taxonomy — the single source of truth for "who is this crawler
 * and what does it do with the fetch".
 *
 * Two consumers, one list:
 *
 * 1. **Visitor classification** (`modules/events/server/utils/visitor-class.ts`)
 *    maps a request's User-Agent to `visitor.class: 'human' | 'agent' | 'bot'`
 *    and, for agents, `visitor.subclass` — the group the token came from.
 *    The agentic-vs-human traffic split is a core KPI (VISION.md).
 * 2. **robots.txt policy** (`modules/ai-robots.ts`) turns the same taxonomy into
 *    `User-agent:` groups so a site can allow AI *answer* traffic while taking a
 *    deliberate stance on AI *training* crawls.
 *
 * The split that matters is **what the fetch is for**, not who operates it:
 * a live fetch that can cite you back is distribution; a training crawl is a
 * one-way donation to a model. They deserve different answers, so they are
 * different lists — and those same lists are what `visitor.subclass` reports,
 * so "what robots.txt says to this crawler" and "how the signal stream counts
 * it" can never disagree.
 *
 * Tokens are matched case-insensitively as substrings of the UA, and are written
 * exactly as the operator publishes them so they can be emitted verbatim into
 * robots.txt.
