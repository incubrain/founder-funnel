body: Not a forecast — a measurement. The crossover already happened, ahead of
  schedule. Sites designed only for human eyes are now illegible to most of
  their readers.

    detail: Every event inked to a buffer you own — nothing pushed, everything pulled.

channels:
  - ch: CH 01
    name: Captures
    detail: Email, presales, bookings — demand lands as signal rows, not inbox noise.
  - ch: CH 02
    name: Events
    detail: Section views and offer clicks — which promise pulled, which one died.
  - ch: CH 03
    name: Errors
    detail: Server and client failures, same stream — a broken site is the loudest
      signal.
  - ch: CH 04
    name: Visitors
    detail: Every row stamped human, agent, or bot — watch the species shift on your
      own site.

    detail: Every row stamped human | agent | bot — agent traffic measured, not
      guessed.
    status: SHIPPED
  - name: MCP tools on every site
    detail: Agents query content and detect changes by hash instead of scraping.

  - name: Raw markdown negotiation
    detail: Plain markdown for agents that ask, on any host.
    status: PLANNED
  - name: FAQ & Organization structured data
    detail: JSON-LD from content the sites already model.
    status: PLANNED
body: Agents don't run your JavaScript — they read structure, or they leave.
  Machine readers are a first-class audience here, and the shipped-vs-planned
  ledger stays honest.
